    "There shouldn't be a substantial disparity between the training R^2 and test R^2. If the training R^2 is considerably higher than the test R^2, it indicates that the model has overfitted and is incapable of generalizing. Such models tend to be complex with very high variance, meaning that even minor changes to the inputs can lead to significant deviations in the output.\n",

    "Regularization techniques, such as Lasso, help eliminate non-significant features from the dataset by setting their coefficients to zero. This simplifies the model, reducing variance. It's important to note, however, that an excessively simple model may lack the robustness to capture the underlying patterns in the training data, leading to what is known as a high bias model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, striking a balance between variance and bias is essential to achieving a generalized and robust model. An optimal model complexity, achieved through techniques like regularization, ensures that the model neither overfits nor oversimplifies, allowing it to generalize well to new data while still capturing meaningful patterns."
